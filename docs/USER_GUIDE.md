# User Manual (Preview)

The Angular client currently provides shell navigation for the dashboard, project explorer, kanban boards, and task list views. Use the sidebar links to switch between areas.

Future iterations will add:

- Authentication experience with registration, login, MFA, and password reset.
- Drag-and-drop board columns and tasks.
- Task detail panel with comments, checklist, attachments, and presence indicators.
- Notification center integrating SignalR live updates.

Refer to the `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design details and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for running the solution.
